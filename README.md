# Primitive | Experience

Learn about the five most commonly used 3d primitives in Unity3d while exploring a virtual reality scene.

## Technology used:

- [Google Cardboard viewer](https://www.google.com/get/cardboard/)
- [Unity3d version 5+](https://unity3d.com/get-unity)
- [Google's Cardboard SDK for Unity](https://developers.google.com/cardboard/unity/download)
- [JScott's cardboard-controls unitypackage](https://github.com/JScott/cardboard-controls/releases/latest)
  This is a great enhancement to the Cardboard SDK that gives great control out of the box with a simple API.
- [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) if you would like to build for iOS.
- [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org) for modeling the 3d building-- I found this program to have a very steep learning curve.

## Clone and run this on your mobile device

- Clone this repo and open Assets/\_FiveThingsScene in Unity 5.  
- Build the project for Android or iOS.  For more info on how to do this if you are unfamiliar, check Unity's site or google.com for more information.
* iOS can be a little bit tricky, see [this link](http://timewavefestival.com/vr-lab-ios-development-set-up-cardboard-demo/) for more information on configuring your build settings in both Unity3d and XCode.
* If you get stuck, Unity3d has [fantastic documentation](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html), and [great forums for asking questions](http://answers.unity3d.com).
* For more information about using C# in Unity, [check out this great video tutorial series](http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/scripting), which got me up and running really quickly.
